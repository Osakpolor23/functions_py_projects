# Mastering Functions and Variables in Python: A Collection of Solved Problem Sets
This repository contains a set of Python programs designed to explore the use of functions and variables in problem-solving. These exercises demonstrate how functions and variables can simplify code and improve logic flow.

## **Problem Sets**
### **1. Tip.py**
**Description:** A program that calculates the tip amount based on the user's bill and desired tip percentage. It ensures accurate and user-friendly handling of numeric input and percentages.

**Key Concepts:**

    Handling numeric input and performing calculations.

    Formatting numbers with a dollar sign.

**Sample Input:**

    How much was the meal? $100

    What percentage would you like to tip? 15%

**Expected Output:**

    Leave $15.00

### **2. Playback.py**
**Description:** A program that slows down speech by adding pauses. It takes a user‚Äôs input string and simulates playback by replacing spaces with ellipses (...).

**Key Concepts:**

    String manipulation with variables.

    Output customization to simulate real-world applications.

**Sample Input:**

    Please enter your text: Hello World


**Expected Output:**

    Hello...world

### **3. Faces.py**
**Objective:** This fun program converts certain textual emoticons into their graphical equivalents. Users can input common emoticons, and the program replaces them with corresponding emojis, enhancing expressiveness.

**Key Concepts:**

    Replacing substrings using functions.

    Enhancing user interaction with string replacements.

**Sample Input:** 

    Enter text and your emoticon here: :)

**Expected Output:**

    üòä

### **4. Indoor.py**
**Description:** A simple program that converts user input to lowercase, emulating "indoor voices." It ensures that all text entered by the user is transformed into a quiet and subdued format.

**Key Concepts:**

    String case manipulation.


**Sample Input:**

    Enter your words here: HELLO THERE

**Expected Output:**

    hello there

### **5. Einstein.py**
**Description:** Inspired by Einstein's formula ***ùê∏ = ùëöùëê^2,*** this program calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass. It demonstrates Python's capability for mathematical computations with user input.

**Key Concepts:**

    Implementing mathematical constants.

    Formatting output in exponential notation.

**Sample Input:**

    m: 2

**Expected Output:**

    E = 1.80e+17 joules
